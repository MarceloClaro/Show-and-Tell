## How Good Is This Model?

The performance published in the original paper shows results comparable to
human performance in certain accuracy/quality metrics. However, due to the
relatively small dataset and
[types of examples available in the training (learning) dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#explore),
the performance varies in the real world.
